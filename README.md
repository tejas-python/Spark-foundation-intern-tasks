# TASK1
Prediction using Supervised ML

(Level - Beginner)

● Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

● This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

● You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool

● Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data

● What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

# Task 2
Prediction using Unsupervised ML

(Level - Beginner)

● From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters
and represent it visually.

● Use R or Python or perform this task

● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

# TASK 6
Prediction using Decision Tree

Algorithm
(Level - Intermediate)

● Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.

● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to
predict the right class accordingly.

● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
